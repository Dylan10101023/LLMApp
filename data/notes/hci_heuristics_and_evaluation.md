# Heuristic Evaluation and Nielsen's Usability Heuristics

## What is a heuristic evaluation?

- A **heuristic evaluation** is a **usability inspection method**.
- A small number of **usability experts** review an interface.
- They compare the interface against a set of **usability heuristics** (generic rules of thumb).
- Goal: find **usability problems** early, cheaply, and without needing a full user study.

### Why it is used

- Fast and relatively low-cost.
- Can be done early with prototypes.
- Helps identify issues with:
  - feedback
  - consistency
  - error messages
  - match to real-world concepts

## Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics (summary)

1. **Visibility of system status**
   - The system should always keep users informed about what is going on.
   - Provide **feedback** within a reasonable time.
   - Example: a loading spinner that shows progress while content is loading.

2. **Match between system and the real world**
   - The system should speak the users’ **language**, with words and concepts familiar to the user.
   - Use real-world **metaphors** and conventions.
   - Example: a trash can icon for delete, using calendar metaphors in scheduling apps.

3. **User control and freedom**
   - Users often choose system functions by mistake.
   - Provide a clear **undo** and **redo**, and easy exits from unwanted states.
   - Example: a “Cancel” button or an “Undo send” in email.

4. **Consistency and standards**
   - Users should not have to wonder whether different words or actions mean the same thing.
   - Follow **platform conventions** and design standards.
   - Example: using the same icon for “search” everywhere in an app.

5. **Error prevention**
   - Design the system to **prevent errors** from happening in the first place.
   - Use **constraints**, sensible defaults, and validation.
   - Example: greying out invalid menu items, or confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.

6. **Recognition rather than recall**
   - Minimize the user’s memory load.
   - Make options and actions **visible** so users recognize them instead of recalling them.
   - Example: menus showing available commands instead of requiring typed commands.

7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
   - Allow **accelerators** for expert users while still being usable for novices.
   - Example: keyboard shortcuts, customizable toolbars.

8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
   - Dialogs should not contain irrelevant information.
   - Clean, **minimalist** interfaces reduce cognitive load.
   - Example: removing clutter from a dashboard so key metrics stand out.

9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
   - Error messages should be in plain language and clearly indicate the problem.
   - Suggest a **constructive solution**.
   - Example: “Password must be at least 8 characters” instead of an obscure code.

10. **Help and documentation**
   - Help content should be easy to search and focused on the user’s tasks.
   - Even if the system is simple, some **documentation** is useful.
