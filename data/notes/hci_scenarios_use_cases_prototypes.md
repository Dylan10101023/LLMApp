# Scenarios, Use Case Task Analysis, and Prototyping

## User Scenarios

- A **scenario** is a short narrative describing how a user achieves a goal in context.
- It usually mentions:
  - The **user** (role, background).
  - The **goal**.
  - The **context** (where, when, devices).
  - The **sequence of actions** and system responses.

### Why we write scenarios

- To understand user **goals** and **tasks** in real situations.
- To support design decisions and communication with stakeholders.
- To test whether the interface supports realistic workflows.

## Use Case Task Analysis

- A **use case** describes how an **actor** interacts with a system to reach a goal.
- A **use case task analysis** breaks a task into **ordered steps**.

### Typical elements of a use case

- **Actor**: who is interacting with the system.
- **Goal**: what the actor wants to achieve.
- **Preconditions**: what must be true before the use case starts.
- **Main success scenario**: the normal sequence of steps.
- **Alternative flows**: what happens when something goes wrong.

### Why it is useful

- Gives a structured view of tasks.
- Helps designers ensure all necessary steps and edge cases are covered.
- Links directly to UI flows and screen designs.

## Prototyping: Low-Fidelity vs High-Fidelity

### Low-fidelity prototypes

- Simple, often **paper** or rough digital sketches.
- Quick and cheap to create.
- Focus on **structure**, **flow**, and concept, not visuals.
- Easier to change based on feedback.
- Good for early **formative** evaluations.

### High-fidelity prototypes

- Look and feel close to the **final product**.
- More detailed visuals, interactions, and sometimes realistic data.
- More expensive and time-consuming to build.
- Better for testing fine-grained **interaction details** and visual design.

### Tradeoffs

- Low-fidelity:
  - + Fast, flexible, supports early exploration.
  - – Users may have trouble imagining final behavior.
- High-fidelity:
  - + Realistic, supports detailed usability tests.
  - – Risk of over-investing too early and being reluctant to change.

## Connection to Heuristic Evaluation

- Both low- and high-fidelity prototypes can be used in **heuristic evaluations**.
- Experts apply **Nielsen’s heuristics** to early prototypes to catch issues before coding.
